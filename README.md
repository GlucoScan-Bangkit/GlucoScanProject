# GlucoScanProject
Welcome to our GlucoScan project! This repository houses a powerful machine learning solution designed to analyze nutrition facts on drink labels. Using image recognition and Optical Character Recognition (OCR), we identifies and extracts critical details ‚Äî specifically the sugar content ‚Äî making it easier to stay informed about your drink choices.

# üåü Key Features
1. Image Recognition: Detect and locate nutrition fact tables on drink labels.
2. OCR Technology: Extract and interpret text from the detected tables with high accuracy.
3. Focus on Health: Automatically capture the sugar amount to help users make healthier choices.

# ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
1. Upload an image of a drink's nutrition facts label.
2. The ML model detects the table containing nutritional details.
3. OCR extracts the relevant data, focusing on the sugar content.
4. Output: The sugar amount in grams is displayed or stored for further use.

# üìÇ Repository Structure

Here's what you'll find in this repository:
Image_Recognition_+_OCR.ipynb: Interactive Jupyter Notebook for testing and experimenting with the model.
image_recognition_+_ocr.py: Python script to run the full pipeline outside of the notebook environment.
final_nutrition_model_ML.h5: Our machine learning model used for image recognition and OCR tasks.
requirements.txt: A list of dependencies to install for running the project.

# üöÄ How to Get Started
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/drink-nutrition-scanner.git
cd drink-nutrition-scanner

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the pipeline:
